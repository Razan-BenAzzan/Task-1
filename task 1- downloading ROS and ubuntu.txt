First Task

we are trying to control a robot with ROS: robotic operating system 
and to use it we need to download it on another operating system, Linux.
we are using Linux over windows for better experience of resources 

before installing Linux, we will be using a VirtualBox for it rather than downloading it directly to the computer

Download Virtual box:
https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads
- download the latest newest version
- open the file and install it
- lunch the app then,

Ubuntu:
 from here https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop
- download the newest version
- go to VirtualBox and select new
- name it as you want, then pick Linux on type field and ubuntu on version field
- select the amount of memory that you want to allocate for the VirtualBox, but we won’t need much memory since we are using Linux
- select "Create a virtual hard disk now" then "VDI (VirtualBox Disk Image)" for easier usage
- select the file location 
- go to settings >Storage> Empty> select the disk the from the menu>choose virtual optical disk file > ubuntu, then,
- go to Shared Folders> the icon for the folder with a plus sign on it> down arrow “other" > 
   navigate to the folder on your operating system that you want to share with the guest operating system  
- start
- install ubuntu


ROS:
http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Installation
- select ROS Noetic Ninjemys
- select ubuntu 
- follow instructions
